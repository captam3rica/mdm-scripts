<img src="readme-images/apple_airdrop.png" alt="drawing" width="124"/>

## Description 

A script to esure that AirDrop Discoverable mode is set to Off.

This script will check whether or not the AirDrop Discoverabe mode is set to off. If Discoverable is not off the script will wait a pre-defined amount of time (TIME_TO_SLEEP) before disabling the service. Otherwise nothing happens. An LauchAgent can be used to control how often the script is executed. A sample LauchAgent can be found in the repo for this project here: https://github.com/insight-cwf/admin-scripts/tree/master/shell/disable-airdrop
